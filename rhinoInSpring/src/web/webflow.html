    <h1>JavaScript Web Flow for Spring</h1>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      <i>JavaScript Web Flow for Spring</i> is a controller component for the 
      MVC architecture of the <a href="http://www.springframework.org"> Spring 
      Framework</a> that uses scripts written in the ECMAScript language (more 
      widely known as "JavaScript") to drive web flows. A web flow is a 
      multi-step series of HTTP requests and responses that comprise a single 
      logical operation (i.e. a checkout procedure in a webshop taking several
      webpages). JSFlow is built on top of the 
      <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Mozilla Rhino ECMAScript 
      interpreter</a>, and leverages its support for continuations.
    </p>
    <h2>Why does it exist?</h2>
    <p>
      For pretty much the same purpose 
      <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/WEBFLOW/Home">
      Spring Web Flow</a> exists. Instead of repeating the arguments presented
      there, we'll just direct you to read 
      <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/articles/article.tss?l=SpringWebFlow">
      this article</a> about it and then return to us.
    </p>
    <h2>Ok, then why a different implementation?</h2>
    <p>
      While we agree with the goals Spring Web Flow strives to achieve, we
      are not comfortable with their flow description language of choice. 
      Namely, they chose to describe page flows in XML. At their heart, page 
      flows are algorithms, and we feel that describing algorithms in a 
      first-class imperative programming language is a more natural fit for the 
      task. It gives you the full expressive power of <i>if</i>, <i>for</i>, 
      <i>switch</i>, etc. statements as well as the ability to define functions
      and call them from multiple places in the flow, reusing common 
      functionality. JavaScript is close enough in syntax to Java and is easy to
      learn. To efficiently edit Spring Web Flow flows, you need to hand craft 
      their XML files, a task that looks complex enough that the Spring 
      community started developing 
      <a href="http://springide.org/project/wiki/WebFlowEditor">graphical 
      editors</a> for maintaining flowgraph XML documents in response to the 
      complexity. In contrast, you can edit a JavaScript web flow in any text
      editor you'd otherwise find fit for writing a snippet of JavaScript in.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, it boils down to a matter of having more than one choice if you want 
      to develop web applications with Spring. If you're comfortable with flows 
      expressed in XML, and eventually being forced to use graphical IDE graph 
      builders to describe control flow of a program, use Spring Web Flow, 
      <i>may it do ya fine</i>. If you prefer writing the same control flow in a
      proper programming language, you might discover <i>JavaScript Web Flow for
      Spring</i> is right for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using continuations, the state of your script is recorded in an 
      encapsulation of its call stack (together with all local variables) 
      whenever it sends back a HTTP response. Not only does it allow you to 
      store state between two requests simply in script local variables, it also
      opens up quite wild possibilities. Namely, the users of your web 
      application can navigate at will in your web application: use the back 
      button of their browser few times then continue from there, or even open a
      new window at a backed page and diverge in two different directions. Your
      web application will seamlessly assume the script states appropriate for
      the current page on the next request, as those states aren't thrown away 
      And remember that you only had to write a single, structured, mostly 
      linear script for all of this! The system manages the mapping of user's
      unpredictable browsing behaviors to your structured-programming script for
      you!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, continuations can be stored in-memory, bound to a HTTP 
      session, or for more sophisticated applications, they can be persisted to 
      a JDBC data source or even let to be managed by the client's browser! 
      Smart stubbing of shared objects is employed that both minimizes the size 
      of the serialized state and allows continuations to be resumed in a 
      different JVM than the one that originally created them, allowing for 
      clustering and failover scenarios.

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>
        We provide a <a href="webflow-tutorial.html">tutorial</a> that builds on the
        example webapp that ships with the distribution.
      </p>
    <h2>Other players in the space</h2>
    <p>
      We already mentioned the Spring's default Spring Web Flow implementation.
      <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Apache Coccoon</a> also has a web flow
      engine based on Rhino, but that engine would probably be hard to integrate
      into Spring proper.
