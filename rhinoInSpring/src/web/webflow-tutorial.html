    <h1>JavaScript Web Flow Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      You are expected to be familiar with Spring MVC and JavaScript. To build
      the example, you need to download the Rhino in Spring distribution, and
      build it running <tt>"ant example"</tt> from its root directory. You will
      find the built web application inside the <tt>build/example</tt> 
      directory. 
    </p> 
    <h2>Configuring the web application</h2>
    <p>
      In its simplest setup, you need to add an instance of the Spring's default
      dispatch servlet to your web application, just as you would with any
      Spring based web application. The relevant section of our example 
      <tt>web.xml</tt> looks like this: 
    </p>   

<table border="1"><tr><td><pre><![CDATA[
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
            <param-value>/WEB-INF/dispatcher-servlet.xml</param-value>
        </init-param>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>*.js</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
]]></pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      This sets up a Spring dispatcher servlet to be configured from the
      <tt>dispatcher-servlet.xml</tt> bean factory and to have all requests
      ending with <tt>.js</tt> forwared to it (since our controllers are
      JavaScript programs) - a quite standard setup for a Spring controller.
    </p><p>
      Next, the dispatcher XML. In its very simplest form, this is all you need 
      to add to it to get the default functionality:
    </p>
      
<table border="1"><tr><td><pre><![CDATA[
  <bean name="/*" class="org.szegedi.spring.web.jsflow.FlowController">
    <property name="useServletPath"><value>true</value></property>
  </bean>
]]></pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      You will of course need to include some view resolver as well (in our
      example, we used the <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net">
      FreeMarker</a> template engine for views, because we're JSP illiterate. 
      You can of course use JSP, Velocity, or any other view technology 
      supported by Spring with this controller.
    </p><p>
      There is also a strong chance that you will need to keep the Rhino context
      used by the controller for the duration of view rendering. If you used 
      Spring with Hibernate, you are already familiar with the concept - it is 
      named "OpenSessionInViewInterceptor" there, and our equivalent is 
      "OpenContextInViewInterceptor". To add it to your dispatcher XML, you need
      to copy these lines:
    </p>
      
<table border="1"><tr><td><pre><![CDATA[
  <bean name="handlerMapping" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping">
    <property name="interceptors">
      <list>
        <bean class="org.szegedi.spring.web.jsflow.OpenContextInViewInterceptor"/>
      </list>
    </property>
  </bean>
]]></pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      (Of course, if you have a more complex Spring application, you might 
      already have interceptors set up - then just add this one to the list).
    </p>
    <h2>Writing scripts and views</h2>
    <p>
      With this setup, you can place a <tt>.js</tt> file anywhere in your web
      application, and if you point your browser at it, it'll start running. 
      Let's take a look at <tt>calculator.js</tt> in the example directory. It 
      looks like this (with interesting pieces in red):
    </p>
      
<table border="1"><tr><td><pre>
var tape = new Array();
tape[0] = 0;
for(;;)
{
    <font color="red">request = respondAndWait("calculator", { tape: tape });</font>
    var operand1 = tape[tape.length - 1];
    try
    {
        var operation = 
            <font color="red">request.getParameter("operator") + " " + 
            request.getParameter("operand");</font>
           
        tape[tape.length] = "&nbsp;&nbsp;" + operation;
        tape[tape.length] = eval(operand1 + " " + operation);
    }
    catch(e)
    {
        tape[tape.length] = "&nbsp;&nbsp;Error: " + e.message;
        tape[tape.length] = operand1;
    }
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      This is basically an infinite loop that keeps adding numbers to a list 
      named "tape", thus emulating an old type calculator that kept the trail
      of the whole calculation on a roll of paper. The <tt>respondAndWait()</tt>
      function will send a response to the user's browser. Here, we're telling
      it to send back the view named "calculator" (this gets mapped by our
      FreeMarker view resolver to "calculator.ftl", but if you used JSP, it'd
      get mapped to "calculator.jsp"), and send it a data model - a map, 
      essentially - with a single element named "tape" whose value is the tape
      variable. Then the <tt>respondAndWait()</tt> will stop and wait for the
      next request to come in from the browser. Let's take a look at the view
      now. (Apologies if you don't read FreeMarker Template Language, but there
      really isn't much of it in there, it's mostly HTML):
    </p>

<table border="1"><tr><td><pre>
&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Tape calculator&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;center>
    &lt;h1>Tape calculator&lt;/h1>
    &lt;p>Emulates a calculator that prints each operation on a tape. Enter an 
    operation and a number. You can use the browser's back button
    to step back as far as you want and continue from there, or you can 
    duplicate browser windows to split the calculation into multiple independent
    calculations as you wish.&lt;/p>
    &lt;hr>
<font color="red">    [#foreach item in tape]
    &lt;p>${item}&lt;/p>
    [/#foreach]</font>
    &lt;hr>
    &lt;form method="POST" <font color="red">action="calculator.js"</font>>
<font color="red">      &lt;input type="hidden" name="stateId" value="${stateId}"></font>
      &lt;table border="0">
        &lt;tr>&lt;td>Operation:&lt;/td>&lt;td>
          &lt;select <font color="red">name="operator"></font>
            &lt;option>+&lt;/option>
            &lt;option>-&lt;/option>
            &lt;option>*&lt;/option>
            &lt;option>/&lt;/option>
          &lt;/select>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
        &lt;tr>&lt;td>Number:&lt;/td>&lt;td>&lt;input type="text" <font color="red">name="operand"</font>>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
        &lt;tr>&lt;td colspan="2">&lt;input type="submit" value="Calculate">&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
      &lt;/table>
    &lt;/form>
    &lt;/center>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html> </pre></td></tr></table>

    <p>
      First, you see a FreeMarker "foreach" directive that'll list all the items
      in the tape on a separate line. Our flow controller takes proper care to
      let the views see JavaScript native arrays as Java Lists and JavaScript 
      native objects as Maps. JavaScript numbers and booleans show up as Java
      Double and Boolean instances, JavaScript strings as Java Strings. It is 
      all rather intuitive. Also, if you somehow create or get a Java object 
      inside your script and pass it to the view, it'll go through unchanged.
      Next, we see how you are expected to create the next request. You see that
      we are sending to the same script - the action of the form element is the 
      same <tt>"calculator.js"</tt>. However, there is a hiden field named 
      <tt>"stateId"</tt> whose value is passed to the view as a data model 
      variable with the identical name (hence <tt>${stateId}</tt> will render
      it in FreeMarker into the output HTML page). This state ID is what 
      connects this page with the script state on the server. Also, the script
      uses two request parameters named <tt>"operator"</tt> and 
      <tt>"operand"</tt> , they're created as a drop-down select and a text 
      field respectively. When the user submits the request, the script state
      on the server wakes up and returns from the <tt>respondAndWait()</tt> 
      call, returning the current <tt>ServletHttpRequest</tt> object to the 
      script. Let's continue examining the script now.
    </p><p>
      Now, it is stunningly simple, really. It retrieves the two request 
      parameters, builds a string concatenating the last entry on the tape with
      the new operator and new operand, and uses JavaScript <tt>eval()</tt>
      function to evaluate the new expression. Then it appends the new operation
      as well as the result to the end of the tape, and loops back to 
      <tt>respondAndWait()</tt>. If an error occurs, it appends the error 
      message to the tape, and also appends the last good value. That's all!
    </p>
    <h2>The real fun begins - Running it all</h2>
    <p>
      By now, you have hopefully built the example, and mapped the 
      <tt>build/example</tt> directory to your servlet container of choice. Go
      and point your browser at the <tt>calculator.js</tt>, and enter few 
      values through several request/response cycles.
    </p><p>
      Now the fun begins.
    </p><p>
      Go back a few steps using your browser's back button, and continue from 
      there. It works from the point where you backed to. Note: you didn't have
      to take care of synchronizing the browser state and the server state, by
      providing custom "back" links or buttons. Your users can freely use the 
      browser's back button.
    </p><p>
      Open a new window from an existing state ("File->New Window" in IE or 
      Fireox, or "Window->Duplicate" in Opera), and continue from there. Now
      return to the original window and contine from there. See how each window
      correctly has its own state - common up to the point of the duplication,
      but separate after that. Play with the back button and new windows freely
      as you wish, and see how the server always catches up with the correct
      state in each window, no matter how many times you split the calculation
      in two again (by duplicating a window) or roll back the calculation (by
      going back with the browser's back button).
    </p><p>
      And now realize that you didn't do anything special to support the user
      wandering through your webapp in multiple windows, going back and forth in
      them. For all you know, you just coded a single, linearly executing 
      infinite loop!
    </p>
    <h2>Advanced concepts</h2>
    <h3>State storage</h3>
    <p>
      By default, the flowstates between two requests are stored in a map
      that is bound to the HTTP session. This is implemented by the class
      <tt><a href="javadoc/org/szegedi/spring/web/jsflow/HttpSessionFlowStateStorage.html">HttpSessionFlowStateStorage</a></tt>
      but you needn't specify it as it is the default created by the flow 
      controller when no other is found in the dispatch XML. By default, the 
      states for the 100 most recent request for every session are being stored.
    </p><p>
      Another option is to store the states in a JDBC database. For this to 
      work, you will have to explicitly create an instance of
      <tt><a href="javadoc/org/szegedi/spring/web/jsflow/JdbcFlowStateStorage.html">JdbcFlowStateStorage</a></tt>.
      There is a commented one in the dispatch XML of the example web 
      application - you can use it to get started, although you'll probably want
      to replace the data source with some connection pooling implementation
      such as Apache DBCP for a real-world application.
     </p><p>
       Yet another option is to store the states in the HTML page generated in
       the response. This is achieved by using an instance of 
      <tt><a href="javadoc/org/szegedi/spring/web/jsflow/ClientSideFlowStateStorage.html">ClientSideFlowStateStorage</a></tt>.
      In this case, the <tt>stateId</tt> variable available to views is not an 
      ID at all, but rather it is a full (textually encoded) representation of 
      the state! It achieves unparalleled scalability, as zero state has to be 
      stored on the server! Of course, entrusting the client to store the state 
      can have potential security implications, so we provide full support for 
      compression, encryption, and digital signing of the flow states to prevent
      the clients from tampering with them - you can employ any, all, or none of
      these features, of course. You can find several commented examples in the
      example dispatcher XML for it. One thing to pay attention to is that you
      should really use HTML forms with POST method to send the next request to
      the server with client-side state storage - you don't want few kilobytes 
      worth of an encoded state showing up in the query string of the URL.
    </p>
    <h3>Includes</h3>
    <p>
      There is a built-in function named <tt>include()</tt> that takes one 
      string as a parameter, interprets it as a path to a script, and executes
      that script in place. It is very handy for creating libraries of reusable
      functions that you can include from any other script.
    </p>
    <h3>Sharing data</h3>
    <p>
      The natural way to share data across different flowstates is the 
      progression of local variables from one flowstate to the one(s) that 
      continue(s) it. All variables are deeply copied from one state to the 
      other, by virtue of whole state being serialized and then deserialized,
      so i.e. changing an array element in a later flowstate doesn't affect the 
      earlier flowstate at all - if you go back to it using the browser's back
      button and progress from there, it'll be as it ever was. There are 
      situations where you need to share data with other flowstates, either in
      the same or in different scripts. I.e. backing to and continuing from 
      halfway of a checkout process in a webshop after it was already completed 
      once might be a bad idea. When writing such an application, you'll want to
      check after each wakeup from <tt>respondAndWait()</tt> whether certain 
      assumptions still hold (i.e. basket is not yet purchased). For this, you
      can use any of the usual venues: HTTP session attributes, servlet context
      attributes, beans in the Spring application context, or maybe the best of
      all, queries against a relational database (either JDBC or some ORM, say
      Hibernate).
    </p>
    <h3>Context demarcation</h3>
    <p>
      If you're using interceptors or servlet filters to govern JDBC connection,
      Hibernate session, or some similar resource's lifetime, you must be aware
      when you code your scripts that your connections/sessions/etc. will get
      closed (flushed/committed/rolled back based on how everything's externally
      configured)  whenever you invoke <tt>wait()</tt> or <tt>respondAndWait()</tt>,
      and newly reopened when the call returns with a new request. Just remember
      to structure your code accordingly.
    </p>
    <h3>finally blocks</h3>
    <p>
      In Rhino, all open <tt>finally</tt> blocks execute even when the execution
      temporarily suspends because of a <tt>wait()</tt> or 
      <tt>respondAndWait()</tt> invocation. To help you differentiate in your
      <tt>finally</tt> blocks between the real final execution of the block and
      the "bogus" one (it has its usages, though) there is a <tt>isGoingToWait()</tt>
      function that returns true when the flow is going to wait, and false when
      it is not.
    </p>
    <h3>What's in the serialized state</h3>
    <p>
      You might wonder what is stored in the serialized flowstate. In short, 
      every variable that is reachable from the script's global scope, as well 
      as all local variables in all call frames currently on the stack. There 
      are few exceptions though. The system recognizes several objects that are
      considered shared, and during serialization these objects are replaced 
      with stubs. Then, when the flowstate is deserialized (because it received
      the next request), the stubs are resolved back to the shared objects, 
      avoiding duplication. The following objects are stubbed:
      <ul>
        <li>the application context object</li>
        <li>all named beans in the application context object and its ancestors</li>
        <li>all objects representing JavaScript functions</li>
        <li>all standard JavaScript global objects (Number, String, RegExp, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      This means that even if you keep a reference to, say, 
      <tt>applicationContext.getBean("foo")</tt> in a local variable between 
      waits, it won't get duplicated, but rather it won't be serialized at all
      and will be rebound to the correct bean next time it is deserialized.
      However, it is important to notice that no other object objects are 
      stubbed, including the following:
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP session or its attributes</li>
        <li>HTTP servlet context or its attributes (although the variable 
        "servletContext" is specially managed - it'll work okay, but you can't 
        assign it to a variable with some other name)</li>
        <li>Any other objects that you can obtain from any of the otherwise
        stubbed object, i.e. application context's parents, or unmanaged objects
        in general returned by various methods of stubbed beans. I.e. in <br />
        <tt>var x = applicationContext.getBean("foo").getBaz()</tt><br />
        the object bound to <tt>x</tt> won't be stubbed. Notice it's okay for it
        to merely exist within the "foo" bean - as the "foo" bean is stubbed, 
        serialization graph will stop at it and none of its internal objects 
        will get serialized either. You just shouldn't forget a reference to it 
        in a local variable, as that new reference will cause it to become 
        directly reachable beyond stub and serialized. In best case, this'll
        lead to duplication of objects upon deserialization. In worst case, the
        newly reachable object isn't serializable at all and throws an exception.
        </li>
      </ul>
